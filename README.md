# Robofriends
ðŸ¤– The place for robots to meat each other.

This is my first React application! It has been created with educational purposes following the course "Zero To Mastery" by Andrei Neaoie ([@aneagoie](https://github.com/aneagoie)) with several modifications.

I used [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) as CSS Framework to give aditional styles, and this two API's:
- [Robohash](https://robohash.org/): For the robot images
- [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/): For the robots info

Features:
- [X] Search by name or any field existing on the user.
- [X] CSS Animated.
- [X] Fully responsive.
